# 🚀 Project FocusFlow: The "Temu" Productivity Suite

[![Project Status: Learning](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Learning-green.svg)]()

## 📝 Overview
FocusFlow is a simplified version of Todoist—a comprehensive learning project designed to master the fundamentals of Web Development. Instead of building five separate small apps, I combined the most essential beginner challenges into one cohesive, responsive dashboard.

This project serves as my "Masterclass" in Vanilla JavaScript, CSS architecture, and DOM manipulation.

## 🛠️ The "All-in-One" Feature Set
By combining these tools, I've tackled the core concepts every developer needs:

* **✅ Smart To-Do List:** Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality with task categorization.
* **⏱️ Pomodoro Timer:** A focus-driven countdown timer (25/5) using asynchronous JS logic.
* **⏰ Multi-Alarm Clock:** A real-time clock with the ability to set and trigger alerts.
* **🧠 Logic Quiz Module:** An integrated "Quick-Quiz" to break up focus sessions and test knowledge.
* **🎨 Premium UI:** Featuring "floating labels," infinite-shake error animations, and unDraw illustrations.
